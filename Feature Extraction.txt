Feature Extraction
--> Leaf Color:

	Extract color histograms or use color moments to capture the color distribution of the leaves.
	Consider features such as average color intensity, dominant colors, or color variance.

--> Shape:

	Use contour detection algorithms to extract leaf shapes.
	Calculate features such as aspect ratio, compactness, or eccentricity to describe leaf shapes.

--> Presence of Lesions:

	Apply segmentation algorithms to detect and quantify lesions or spots on the leaves.
	Extract features such as lesion count, lesion area distribution, or lesion density.
